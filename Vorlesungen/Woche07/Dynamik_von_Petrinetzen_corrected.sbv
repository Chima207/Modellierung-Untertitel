0:00:00.000,0:00:08.580
In this video, we will again look
at a few formal aspects of Petri nets.

0:00:08.580,0:00:09.570
Reminder:

0:00:09.570,0:00:16.740
We had formally defined Petri nets
as a tuple containing a set

0:00:16.740,0:00:22.950
of places S and a set
of transitions T, plus various other ingredients.

0:00:22.950,0:00:32.640
Among them were markings, i.e. functions from the
set of places S into the natural numbers.

0:00:32.640,0:00:36.450
No negative numbers, but
zero and positive integers.

0:00:38.670,0:00:42.990
That was used, among other things,
to express the pre- and postweights.

0:00:42.990,0:00:45.090
These were
these special functions.

0:00:45.090,0:00:49.410
For individual transitions, respectively
the precondition weights and the

0:00:49.410,0:00:52.110
postcondition weights
as such markings.

0:00:52.110,0:00:59.070
The connection to the graphical representation
was, first, that the initial marking m0

0:00:59.070,0:01:02.930
corresponded to the occupancy of the places
at the beginning on the graphical page.

0:01:02.930,0:01:08.670
Since, the marking function m0
would be used to count

0:01:08.670,0:01:14.550
exactly the tokens for each
place shown in the graphical representation.

0:01:14.550,0:01:17.490
And the arrows in
the graphical representation correspond

0:01:17.490,0:01:21.780
exactly to the pre and
post weights in a certain way.

0:01:23.640,0:01:32.460
In particular, if there is to be no arrow from s
to t or from t to s (in each case in the

0:01:32.460,0:01:40.110
appropriate order), that from it can
be read whether the pre-weight condition function

0:01:40.110,0:01:44.490
for that transition carries the value
zero with respect to the corresponding place.

0:01:44.490,0:01:49.530
Or analogously for
the post-weight function:

0:01:51.330,0:01:53.730
If there are zeros
in the mathematical representation, there

0:01:53.730,0:01:55.500
is simply no arrow
in the graphical representation.

0:01:55.500,0:02:00.390
Then there was the situation that there was
an arrow, but there was nothing on it.

0:02:00.390,0:02:01.830
This would
correspond to the

0:02:01.830,0:02:07.530
cases where the pre-weight and post-weight functions
for the corresponding transition and place are 1.

0:02:07.530,0:02:10.290
Differently, we had
seen in the tool

0:02:10.290,0:02:12.030
that there the arrows are
always labeled with a 1.

0:02:12.030,0:02:17.860
So even with the arrows that
would carry a 1 and therefore in

0:02:17.860,0:02:20.290
the simplified graphical representation
in the slides, for example,

0:02:20.290,0:02:26.110
are not labeled with a number, the
1 was still explicitly there in the tool.

0:02:26.110,0:02:32.530
On the slides, I actually write the
weights only if they are greater than 1.

0:02:32.530,0:02:37.960
So if the
pre-weight and post-weight

0:02:37.960,0:02:42.190
condition for a transition and
place is an integer greater than

0:02:42.190,0:02:48.400
1, then there would be an arrow
on the slides or in the exercises.

0:02:48.400,0:02:49.840
If there is nothing on
it, then it is a 1.

0:02:49.840,0:02:52.480
And in the tool, the
1 is even written on it.

0:02:54.280,0:02:55.630
That's just
a repetition.

0:02:55.630,0:02:58.030
This is nothing new
that I told you.

0:02:58.030,0:03:01.150
You've already seen that
and you've also practiced that.

0:03:04.090,0:03:08.845
Then now we're going to operate
with these "ingredients," specifically these markings.

0:03:08.845,0:03:11.560
We're going to have a couple
of terms and a couple of definitions

0:03:11.560,0:03:17.470
that are defined for markings and because
of that, they then apply to the initial

0:03:17.470,0:03:20.110
marking as well as they can be
used for these pre-weight and post-weight functions.

0:03:20.830,0:03:27.700
And also for other markings that arise in
the course of the development of a Petri net.

0:03:27.700,0:03:29.740
So not just the
initial marking, but also markings

0:03:29.740,0:03:34.000
that may be present, for example,
after some transitions have been executed.

0:03:34.000,0:03:41.200
And then we just need
some mathematical terms and applications.

0:03:43.660,0:03:47.170
So on the one hand,
there will be an order

0:03:47.170,0:03:50.080
on markings, and on
the other hand, certain operations.

0:03:50.080,0:03:53.290
On this slide, first
of all, to the order.

0:03:53.290,0:03:57.730
We'll consider any two
markings for the same

0:03:57.730,0:04:00.070
Petri net, so for
the same set of places.

0:04:00.070,0:04:03.940
Then we have two markings, that is,
mappings from these places to natural numbers.

0:04:03.940,0:04:06.010
I'll call them
m and m'.

0:04:06.010,0:04:07.570
The m' has nothing
to do with derivatives.

0:04:07.570,0:04:12.126
It's not somehow the differential
calculus stroke: f and f'.

0:04:12.126,0:04:14.350
They are just
two different names.

0:04:14.350,0:04:16.930
You could have
also said m1, m2.

0:04:18.430,0:04:21.430
And then how is it defined
that m' is less than-equal to m?

0:04:22.450,0:04:25.730
If it is true
for all places from the

0:04:25.730,0:04:29.750
corresponding underlying set that m' of s is
less than or equal to m of s.

0:04:29.750,0:04:34.220
So, that at the place
s the marking m' carries a

0:04:34.220,0:04:37.730
smaller value or the same value
as m at the corresponding place.

0:04:37.730,0:04:40.850
And this must be
true for all places.

0:04:40.850,0:04:46.940
Then we say that the marking m'
is altogether less-than-equal to the marking m.

0:04:46.940,0:04:52.850
That's not about what the sum
of the numbers for the marking is.

0:04:52.850,0:04:54.530
How many tokens
there are in total.

0:04:54.530,0:04:56.690
Instead, it must
be true for each

0:04:56.690,0:05:02.555
token that m' carries a smaller value
or at most the same value as m.

0:05:03.380,0:05:05.960
Then we also say:
m' is covered by m.

0:05:05.960,0:05:11.720
Finally, we check that m has at least
as many tokens as m' for each place.

0:05:11.720,0:05:14.060
So, does
m overlap m'?

0:05:17.870,0:05:18.530
Example:

0:05:18.530,0:05:23.090
Suppose our set of
places S is three-elementary.

0:05:23.090,0:05:28.430
We have already said that we can
write down such finite functions by simply

0:05:28.430,0:05:32.360
specifying (in that case) a triple, because
there are supposed to be three places.

0:05:32.360,0:05:35.090
Then our m could
be the triple (0,1,2).

0:05:35.090,0:05:41.480
And m', of course seen for the
same order of places, the triple (0,0,1).

0:05:41.480,0:05:47.780
And then it would indeed hold here that
m' is less-equal to m, but not vice versa.

0:05:47.780,0:05:48.920
Why is
m' <= m?

0:05:48.920,0:05:54.590
Because 0 is less than or equal to 0, and 0 is less
than or equal to 1, and 1 is less than or equal to 2.

0:05:54.590,0:05:55.730
But the reverse
is not true.

0:05:56.540,0:06:00.710
The 0 <= 0 is still
true, but not 1 <= 0.

0:06:01.610,0:06:09.800
In that case, we would say
that marking is covered by this marking.

0:06:09.800,0:06:15.125
It really depends on
the comparison of each element.

0:06:15.125,0:06:15.890
Also, this
is still true:

0:06:15.890,0:06:17.900
Every marking is
covered by itself, trivially,

0:06:17.900,0:06:22.160
because it is less-equal,
namely equal, at every position.

0:06:22.160,0:06:24.890
But what is not true
is for example this one.

0:06:24.890,0:06:31.820
So although the second marking here
is much fuller in a place

0:06:31.820,0:06:35.570
(1000), which is much larger
than everything in the first marking.

0:06:36.140,0:06:40.010
Nevertheless, this marking is
not covered by this one.

0:06:40.010,0:06:41.330
Why
not?

0:06:41.330,0:06:44.390
Because it is not
true in the third place.

0:06:44.990,0:06:46.940
But it would have to be
true for every place that the

0:06:46.940,0:06:48.860
number, which stands here is smaller-equal
to the number, which stands there.

0:06:48.860,0:06:53.690
This is the case for 3 and 5
and for 1000, but not for 2 and 1.

0:06:53.690,0:06:57.290
Sometimes it is simply not
the case that the overlap exists.

0:06:57.290,0:07:00.740
And it may also be that
it is not present in either direction.

0:07:00.740,0:07:03.440
That was already the case
here, and indeed also here.

0:07:04.340,0:07:11.300
Although here in both markings simply the numbers 0,
1, 2 occur, it is neither the case that

0:07:11.300,0:07:14.150
the first marking is covered
by the second, nor vice versa.

0:07:14.150,0:07:18.980
Because there is in each case a place,
namely either the second or the third position,

0:07:18.980,0:07:24.290
where in each case it is
violated that this applies to all places.

0:07:27.080,0:07:30.950
So this is how we can compare
two markings, be it the initial marking

0:07:30.950,0:07:33.410
and a weight
marking, or two weight

0:07:33.410,0:07:37.640
markings, or just two markings that occur
later in the development of the Petri net.

0:07:38.450,0:07:48.140
We'll write this "<=", which is what
you're most likely to know for numbers.

0:07:48.140,0:07:51.230
Mathematicians like to use
this for all sorts of

0:07:51.230,0:07:53.900
structures, including such
marking functions, for example.

0:07:56.510,0:07:57.950
Then it said
something about operations.

0:07:57.950,0:08:00.440
This is just an
order relation, not an operation.

0:08:00.440,0:08:02.690
So nothing that
creates a new marking.

0:08:02.690,0:08:07.520
But there are some
of these, especially the addition.

0:08:07.520,0:08:11.030
So if we have
again two such markings, for

0:08:11.030,0:08:16.640
the same set of places, then we
define a third marking, which is the sum.

0:08:16.640,0:08:19.550
Now here's this somewhat funny
plus with a circle around it.

0:08:19.550,0:08:25.790
That's simply choosing a symbol
that's not the obvious plus (which

0:08:25.790,0:08:29.150
you know from numbers), but
still reminds you of addition.

0:08:29.150,0:08:32.540
That's where people like to
take symbols of about that shape.

0:08:32.540,0:08:36.170
So a plus in a circle,
because it's not the plus on numbers.

0:08:36.170,0:08:39.260
Not 3 + 5, but
the plus between two such markings.

0:08:41.390,0:08:42.050
What comes
out of it?

0:08:42.050,0:08:46.840
A marking, which must be a
function of S into the natural numbers.

0:08:46.840,0:08:47.980
And how
is it defined?

0:08:47.980,0:08:48.850
Well,
in places.

0:08:48.850,0:08:56.260
So for each element of S, we
define our new marking as given at that

0:08:56.260,0:09:02.860
place, by the sum of the
two original markings at the same place.

0:09:03.970,0:09:05.080
That's simply
a definition.

0:09:05.080,0:09:08.020
So for each s,
we define a natural number.

0:09:08.020,0:09:13.300
And then that is the
result marking of that addition.

0:09:13.300,0:09:19.360
For example, if again for the
three-element set S we have the markings

0:09:19.360,0:09:22.750
(0,1,2) and (0,0,1), then their
sum would again be a

0:09:22.750,0:09:27.310
marking for this three-element
place set, therefore a triple.

0:09:27.310,0:09:34.600
And that is 0 + 0 = 0, 1
+ 0 = 1, and 2 + 1 = 3.

0:09:34.600,0:09:36.250
So this is
like vector addition.

0:09:36.250,0:09:40.720
If you were to
write things down vertically,

0:09:40.720,0:09:42.910
that would be a triple
vector and another triple vector.

0:09:42.910,0:09:44.860
You know this from
school (linear algebra), there

0:09:44.860,0:09:47.560
just comes out
a vector, element-wise/place-wise added.

0:09:48.610,0:09:50.590
Exactly the same
happens for these markings.

0:09:54.010,0:09:54.970
You can do
that for addition.

0:09:54.970,0:09:56.770
You can do
the same for subtraction.

0:09:56.770,0:09:58.210
Then you just have
to be a little careful,

0:09:58.210,0:10:02.755
because it says here that it
always has to be natural numbers.

0:10:02.755,0:10:07.270
And it's unfortunately not
the case that when you

0:10:07.270,0:10:08.740
subtract any two natural numbers, the
result is always a natural number.

0:10:09.640,0:10:15.850
For example with 3 and 5 this is not the case, 3
+ 5 = 8 but 3 - 5 is not a natural number.

0:10:15.850,0:10:20.410
Therefore, subtraction is defined
only for the case where

0:10:20.410,0:10:29.110
we want to subtract from m
a marking that is covered by m.

0:10:29.800,0:10:33.820
Here we use the relation,
the order, from the slide before.

0:10:33.820,0:10:37.840
So if m' <=
m, as defined before,

0:10:37.840,0:10:42.130
then we can say the subtraction of
m and m' is in that order:

0:10:48.940,0:10:52.240
For each place, it must hold that
the new marking at the place no

0:10:52.240,0:10:58.450
longer carries as its value the sum,
but the difference, of the two original sets.

0:10:58.450,0:11:00.490
The order is
of course important.

0:11:00.490,0:11:00.760
That we subtract m' from m and
not vice versa. Here it is okay.

0:11:00.760,0:11:02.740
There will actually
come out a natural

0:11:02.740,0:11:05.620
number, if we knew before
that m' is covered by m.

0:11:05.620,0:11:10.960
Because then it is exactly the case
that this difference can never be negative.

0:11:10.960,0:11:12.040
So that will
then fit exactly.

0:11:13.840,0:11:17.560
Again, an example: (0,1,2)
minus (0,0,1) would be (0,1,1).

0:11:17.560,0:11:23.260
So don't add element by
element, but subtract element by element.

0:11:23.260,0:11:27.040
We may not turn this around
here; here above of course already.

0:11:27.760,0:11:31.330
Here above for the sum
we could have also written:

0:11:31.330,0:11:34.750
What is written here as second
plus what is written here as first.

0:11:34.750,0:11:42.340
This is also defined and results in
the same triple, because this addition is commutative.

0:11:42.340,0:11:43.990
That does not apply
here for the subtraction,

0:11:43.990,0:11:48.790
because this condition would not be
fulfilled then for the other direction.

0:11:56.820,0:12:00.090
Then we can
use these terms now.

0:12:00.090,0:12:02.820
These were only definitions of
mathematical kind for these markings.

0:12:02.820,0:12:05.340
This has nothing to
do with Petri nets.

0:12:05.340,0:12:09.150
But we just want
to use that to describe

0:12:09.960,0:12:14.130
the dynamics, the semantics, the meaning
(ultimately the execution) of Petri nets.

0:12:16.470,0:12:17.310
What was
important there?

0:12:17.310,0:12:18.600
Being
activated.

0:12:19.350,0:12:22.650
Is a transition in
a Petri net activated?

0:12:22.650,0:12:24.480
Only then
can anything happen.

0:12:24.480,0:12:25.440
And what
happens then?

0:12:25.440,0:12:28.470
The transition fires and leads
to a new marking, to a

0:12:28.470,0:12:30.270
new allocation of the
places in the Petri net.

0:12:31.170,0:12:35.130
We can now formally define these two
concepts using the terms we have seen.

0:12:37.020,0:12:40.770
So first
the activation.

0:12:40.770,0:12:45.420
When is a transition
activated for a particular marking?

0:12:45.420,0:12:48.510
So we have to have a marking,
we have to know where the tokens are.

0:12:48.510,0:12:51.000
And then we can look
at a transition and ask

0:12:51.000,0:12:54.570
if that transition is activated
right now for the current marking.

0:12:54.570,0:13:00.540
That's the case when
the pre-weight function for that

0:13:00.540,0:13:04.710
particular transition is covered
by the current marking.

0:13:04.710,0:13:09.960
This means exactly that at all
places where this transition expects tokens, i.e.

0:13:09.960,0:13:15.060
where the function value of
this function is greater than

0:13:15.060,0:13:19.770
0, the marking m also contains at
least as many tokens (or maybe even more).

0:13:20.700,0:13:21.090
This must be
true for every place.

0:13:21.090,0:13:22.860
A transition can
already not fire if

0:13:22.860,0:13:28.020
there are not enough tokens in the
current marking for one of its input places.

0:13:29.490,0:13:32.580
What is written here in the
parentheses is simply the verbalization of what

0:13:32.580,0:13:42.090
the definition of the order relation
of the penultimate slide provides here.

0:13:42.090,0:13:45.450
So it succinctly captures
when a transition is activated.

0:13:45.450,0:13:47.160
And when it
is, it can fire.

0:13:47.160,0:13:52.530
So, let t be a transition and m be
a marking such that t is activated for m.

0:13:52.530,0:13:54.480
Then it
can fire.

0:13:54.480,0:13:57.030
This means that a
new marking comes out.

0:13:57.030,0:13:57.930
And what does
it look like?

0:13:58.530,0:14:00.660
We can now rewrite
it with our subtraction/addition.

0:14:00.660,0:14:01.950
Intuitively we
had said:

0:14:01.950,0:14:05.340
We take correspondingly
many tokens from all

0:14:06.810,0:14:10.140
places of the precondition, that
is, with incoming arrows to t.

0:14:10.140,0:14:12.840
Where "correspondingly many"
depends on what this

0:14:12.840,0:14:15.570
function says here
for the individual places.

0:14:15.570,0:14:21.630
And on the other hand, afterwards
we add suitably many tokens to the

0:14:21.630,0:14:25.890
post-weight places, that is, to the places for
which this post-weight function has a positive value.

0:14:25.890,0:14:27.750
This is exactly
the same as saying:

0:14:27.750,0:14:30.090
We take the current
marking, subtract from it the

0:14:30.090,0:14:35.430
pre-weight function for the corresponding t, and
add the post-weight function on top of it.

0:14:35.430,0:14:40.950
After all, this is the same transition in each
case, and it is the one we are firing.

0:14:40.950,0:14:45.660
And we must know beforehand that t
is really activated for this marking m.

0:14:45.660,0:14:49.590
Because only then we
can form this subtraction.

0:14:49.590,0:14:53.310
So this all fits together with the
condition in the previous slide about when we're

0:14:53.310,0:14:54.990
allowed to form the
subtraction in the first place.

0:14:57.000,0:15:02.910
Things play together exactly so
that it makes sense overall.

0:15:08.190,0:15:10.710
What's meant by
the parentheses here is:

0:15:10.710,0:15:12.540
First we subtract
and then we add.

0:15:12.540,0:15:15.630
You could have
added parentheses there.

0:15:17.850,0:15:22.920
If that is so, then we also want to
express more concisely: m becomes m' when t is fired.

0:15:22.920,0:15:24.360
And that is
how it is written.

0:15:25.410,0:15:32.520
This is a syntax
formulated as a formula

0:15:32.520,0:15:36.420
for: t now fires from here
to there and out comes m'.

0:15:36.420,0:15:41.010
And this is exactly the m'
which results from these arithmetic operations.

0:15:44.640,0:15:45.900
That would
be a step.

0:15:45.900,0:15:49.230
So from a marking we
make a step with a certain

0:15:49.230,0:15:53.280
transition and get a
certain new marking m'.

0:15:53.280,0:15:56.190
That could happen to
be the same one.

0:15:57.660,0:16:00.030
But generally
some marking m'.

0:16:00.030,0:16:05.760
Then obviously m' is reachable
in a step of m.

0:16:05.760,0:16:08.686
This can still be generalized
or taken in a different way.

0:16:08.686,0:16:12.000
Namely, one can
ask whether some marking,

0:16:12.000,0:16:15.270
not necessarily m', but some
other marking, is reachable from m.

0:16:15.270,0:16:16.890
Perhaps also
in several steps.

0:16:16.890,0:16:19.650
This gives
our next definition.

0:16:20.310,0:16:25.680
We say a marking
is reachable, usually from m0.

0:16:25.680,0:16:27.450
So we have a start
marking for the Petri net.

0:16:27.450,0:16:31.680
We wonder if some other
marking is reachable from it.

0:16:31.680,0:16:34.500
How is this defined and
when is it the case?

0:16:34.500,0:16:36.960
When there is a
certain sequence of transitions.

0:16:36.960,0:16:40.590
This could be a single transition, it
could be zero, it could be 27,

0:16:40.590,0:16:43.350
but somehow a finite
sequence t_1 to t_n.

0:16:43.350,0:16:46.620
In that, transitions may
occur more than once.

0:16:46.620,0:16:49.200
So maybe our Petri
net has three transitions,

0:16:49.200,0:16:53.100
but we want to
have a 27 long sequence.

0:16:53.100,0:16:58.350
Then at least one transition
must occur more than once.

0:16:58.350,0:17:06.180
So any transitions t_1 to t_n,
possibly occurring more than once, so

0:17:06.180,0:17:13.620
that m0 becomes m1 by firing t1, exactly this m1
becomes m3 by firing t2, and so on, and so on.

0:17:14.400,0:17:19.440
And in the end, our m comes out,
which we wondered if it is reachable from m0.

0:17:19.440,0:17:26.880
And if it is, then m
is called reachable from the initial marking.

0:17:26.880,0:17:34.140
Sometimes we don't even care
what these intermediate markings are.

0:17:34.140,0:17:37.920
Then we only want to know that we can
get from m0 to m by t_1 to t_n.

0:17:37.920,0:17:42.930
Then this is also written shortened as:
just m0, then all transitions are written here

0:17:42.930,0:17:47.460
directly in these special
brackets (not each one separately),

0:17:47.460,0:17:51.300
and we write only the end
token there (not also all intermediate markings).

0:17:51.300,0:17:59.640
Or if we summarized this list
t_1 to t_n, as here t-"snake", so

0:17:59.640,0:18:06.780
another identifier; then we also write, m0
passes into m under this whole sequence.

0:18:06.780,0:18:11.010
The sequence is then
called a firing sequence.

0:18:11.010,0:18:16.350
These are exactly the lists that show up
in the tool in the previous video in

0:18:16.350,0:18:20.160
the left window, but
written one below the other.

0:18:20.160,0:18:22.890
I had single transitions
in my Petri nets.

0:18:22.890,0:18:29.520
There I simulated, started
executions and carried out circuits,

0:18:29.520,0:18:34.200
and in the left window the
transitions always appeared under each other.

0:18:34.200,0:18:35.310
That would be
such a firing sequence.

0:18:35.310,0:18:38.370
At the beginning
it was empty.

0:18:38.370,0:18:40.260
One can also have
the empty firing sequence.

0:18:40.260,0:18:46.740
Then, of course, the m
is necessarily equal to the m0.

0:18:46.740,0:18:49.680
Each marking, also
the initial marking

0:18:49.680,0:18:53.280
m0, passes under empty
firing sequence naturally into itself.

0:18:53.280,0:18:56.220
One can also have the situation that
there is only the empty firing sequence.

0:18:56.880,0:19:03.870
If I have no activated transitions at all
in the initial marking of the Petri net,

0:19:03.870,0:19:06.525
then the only possible firing
sequence is the empty firing sequence.

0:19:06.525,0:19:10.620
But in general, it will
be the case that we will

0:19:10.620,0:19:14.220
have finite and non-empty
transition sequences that are fireable.

0:19:14.220,0:19:15.780
Then we have
an interesting model.

0:19:15.780,0:19:22.040
That was
the definition.

0:19:22.040,0:19:24.470
Let's talk through this
with a concrete example.

0:19:24.470,0:19:27.380
This is the example I had
on a slide last week where we

0:19:27.380,0:19:32.300
were talking about the equivalence
of graphical and mathematical representation.

0:19:32.300,0:19:34.820
So there is a slide,
in last week's slides, where

0:19:34.820,0:19:38.450
the mathematical representation
is given for this.

0:19:38.450,0:19:41.630
We need that here now as
well, because these terms refer to that,

0:19:41.630,0:19:43.010
especially these
marking functions.

0:19:43.010,0:19:55.700
Here we have the initial marking, that
would be as marking m0 of course

0:19:55.700,0:19:58.400
(1,2,0) because I have the
place order s1, s2, s3.

0:19:58.400,0:20:02.060
So the initial marking
here would be: first component

0:20:02.060,0:20:05.690
1, second component
2, third component 0.

0:20:05.690,0:20:11.480
Now it is claimed here that the marking
m2 = (1,1,1) is reachable in two steps.

0:20:11.480,0:20:13.760
Intuitively, this means it
must be possible to

0:20:13.760,0:20:15.440
perform exactly two
circuits/firings of transitions so

0:20:15.440,0:20:28.355
that somehow the tokens move in such a way
that afterwards there is exactly one token on each position.

0:20:28.355,0:20:29.810
That's what this
marking here says.

0:20:29.810,0:20:32.660
And we can just try
that out and do the math.

0:20:34.490,0:20:40.220
We can see that of these three transitions,
only t1 is activated at the beginning anyway.

0:20:40.220,0:20:42.950
Therefore, the first circuit really
has to happen with t1.

0:20:42.950,0:20:52.250
The pre-weight function for t1 is (1,1,0), because
there must be something on the first two places.

0:20:52.250,0:20:56.420
There are incoming arrows, and
without a number written on them,

0:20:56.420,0:20:58.400
so this corresponds
to weight 1.

0:20:58.400,0:21:04.010
There is no incoming arrow from
s3 to t1, so this is zero.

0:21:04.010,0:21:07.100
That's what it had said
on the slide last week.

0:21:07.100,0:21:12.530
This marking is covered
by the start marking.

0:21:12.530,0:21:15.290
The m0 in this
case would be (1,2,0).

0:21:15.290,0:21:23.300
There this relation is valid,
because at every position the value,

0:21:23.300,0:21:25.730
which is here, is at least
as high as the value here.

0:21:25.730,0:21:28.280
So firing is possible
in the first place.

0:21:28.280,0:21:32.540
Of course we already knew
this by looking at this

0:21:32.540,0:21:36.440
graphic, but mathematically
this is well defined.

0:21:36.440,0:21:37.220
What do
we get then?

0:21:37.220,0:21:39.890
The next marking
is our start marking

0:21:39.890,0:21:46.130
m0 minus the pre-weight function for
t1, plus the post-weight function for t1.

0:21:46.130,0:21:51.860
There we could also look at the old
slides and it would say that this is (0,0,2).

0:21:52.370,0:21:58.550
Ultimately because there are no arrows from t1 to s1
and s2, but there is this 2 arrow to s3.

0:21:58.550,0:22:01.160
So we
have this calculation:

0:22:01.160,0:22:08.450
We have (1,2,0) as
m0, minus (1,1,0), plus (0,0,2).

0:22:08.450,0:22:11.720
Then calculating element by
element we get (0,1,2).

0:22:11.720,0:22:17.690
1 - 1 + 0 = 0, 2 - 1 +
0 = 1, and 0 - 0 + 2 = 2.

0:22:19.640,0:22:26.600
So the marking m1 after firing t1
in the start situation is this marking.

0:22:28.040,0:22:29.960
Now if we want to
know what happens in two steps,

0:22:29.960,0:22:32.570
we have to make the next step
starting from this, not from m0 anymore.

0:22:34.070,0:22:42.710
We can see, this current marking
(0,1,2) covers the pre-weight of t2.

0:22:42.710,0:22:47.990
The pre-weight function of t2 is (0,0,1)
because it only takes something from s3.

0:22:47.990,0:22:51.920
This (0,0,1) is covered by
it, so t2 is executable.

0:22:54.500,0:23:00.230
Then m2 is the current marking
m1 minus exactly this (0,0,1), so it

0:23:00.230,0:23:04.190
is the pre-weight function of t2,
plus the post-weight function of t2.

0:23:04.190,0:23:05.510
If we look
there what happens:

0:23:05.510,0:23:10.880
t2 puts a token after s1 and
nothing else, so the function is (1,0,0).

0:23:10.880,0:23:19.070
As a calculation, we get from
up here: (0,1,2) - (0,0,1) + (1,0,0).

0:23:19.730,0:23:24.830
And if we do this again element
by element, we get the marking (1,1,1).

0:23:24.830,0:23:30.710
So after firing t1 and t2, from
the original marking, we would reach the

0:23:30.710,0:23:34.560
situation as it is claimed here above, where
on all three places there is exactly one token.

0:23:34.560,0:23:43.830
So it is valid: m0 under
firing of t1 passes to this

0:23:43.830,0:23:48.150
m1, and under firing of
t2 this passes to this m2.

0:23:48.150,0:23:51.630
Or written shorter (if we don't
want to note the m1 at

0:23:51.630,0:23:56.130
all): m0 passes to m2
under firing of t1 and t2.

0:23:56.130,0:23:59.430
Calculated
this way.

0:23:59.430,0:24:01.380
Of course, we will not
always recalculate this in such detail.

0:24:01.380,0:24:04.800
But it
must be understood,

0:24:04.800,0:24:08.700
because later definitions will
work with these terms.

0:24:08.700,0:24:12.240
Often, we will certainly
just work with intuition, based

0:24:12.240,0:24:14.022
on the
graphical representation.

0:24:14.022,0:24:14.097
That's what I did in the
modeling example in the previous video.

0:24:14.097,0:24:20.250
I didn't always
do the math, but

0:24:20.250,0:24:24.090
simply worked with the tool
and the intuition behind it.

0:24:26.970,0:24:32.250
It is still important that this is
now simply the firing for this concrete sequence.

0:24:32.250,0:24:36.330
So it's not that m0 always
does this and then m2 comes out.

0:24:36.330,0:24:39.510
But here it only says
that m0 can change into this

0:24:39.510,0:24:42.450
concrete marking m2 by
firing t1 and t2.

0:24:42.450,0:24:45.510
There can also be other
firing sequences starting from m0.

0:24:46.470,0:24:51.570
In the concrete case for example
it is also valid that m0 reaches

0:24:51.570,0:24:56.400
m1 after firing t1 as above, but
after that also t3 would have been fireable.

0:24:56.400,0:24:58.230
So a different
transition than t2.

0:24:58.230,0:25:01.230
And then a completely different
final marking would have come out.

0:25:01.230,0:25:03.300
This is not
a contradiction or wrong.

0:25:03.300,0:25:08.220
But the firing always refers
to a concrete sequence of transitions.

0:25:08.220,0:25:11.610
For other transitions of course
another marking can come out.

0:25:11.610,0:25:14.790
This follows mathematically
from the definition.

0:25:14.790,0:25:20.790
But this is also an essential
property of Petri nets, namely non-determinism.

0:25:20.790,0:25:26.340
That is, it is possible, in the
same situation, for example situation m1 (which

0:25:26.340,0:25:33.990
we have reached here), to
evolve differently for different transitions.

0:25:33.990,0:25:38.140
The term for
this is "non-determinism".

0:25:38.140,0:25:41.770
Petri nets are
non-deterministic, not predetermined.

0:25:41.770,0:25:47.830
That is, there can be multiple
direct successor markings to a concrete marking.

0:25:47.830,0:25:49.750
Of course, there can
always be several successor markings,

0:25:49.750,0:25:51.400
since we are
considering several steps.

0:25:51.970,0:25:56.170
But even for the next concrete
step there can be different results.

0:25:56.170,0:25:58.750
Of course only if
we apply different transitions.

0:25:58.750,0:26:03.070
So the same marking
and the same transition lead

0:26:03.070,0:26:05.590
to the
same successor marking.

0:26:05.590,0:26:11.770
We can't get different
markings from m1 with t1.

0:26:11.770,0:26:21.250
But here with m1 and t2 or
m1 and t3 we get different markings.

0:26:21.250,0:26:24.310
If we have a
marking, and we can choose

0:26:24.310,0:26:28.660
different transitions, we can get
different new markings in the process.

0:26:28.660,0:26:32.530
Now at this point, from the
student side, the question likes to come:

0:26:34.600,0:26:35.740
Who
decides that?

0:26:36.670,0:26:38.530
Who chooses
the transition?

0:26:38.530,0:26:43.150
Or who chooses which of the
several successor markings is the right one?

0:26:43.150,0:26:46.420
For modeling, this
question does not arise.

0:26:46.420,0:26:47.860
That is not
our goal in modeling.

0:26:47.860,0:26:50.320
In modeling, we want
to describe all possibilities.

0:26:50.320,0:26:55.180
Nowhere in the Petri net does
it say which transition to take.

0:26:55.180,0:26:59.320
The Petri net describes, under a
certain constellation, which transitions are possible.

0:26:59.320,0:27:03.970
And also expresses what
this does to the marking.

0:27:03.970,0:27:07.810
What the next marking would
be for a chosen transition.

0:27:07.810,0:27:11.290
The model does not make a
selection of which transition to take.

0:27:11.290,0:27:14.590
That might be a
task for implementing a system

0:27:14.590,0:27:17.140
previously modeled
with Petri nets.

0:27:17.140,0:27:20.290
Perhaps one wants to
follow certain protocols in a

0:27:20.290,0:27:23.500
concrete
executable system.

0:27:23.500,0:27:29.020
So choosing certain strategies among all
the possibilities given by the model.

0:27:29.020,0:27:30.790
But that is no
longer part of the modeling.

0:27:34.090,0:27:35.560
This is
an important concept.

0:27:35.560,0:27:38.230
Without non-determinism, Petri nets
would not be as interesting.

0:27:38.230,0:27:46.180
And because Petri nets are
nondeterministic (i.e., different subsequent markings can

0:27:46.180,0:27:48.340
arise from one
marking), if we

0:27:48.340,0:27:54.880
want to get an overview of how a
Petri net can evolve, there is a very

0:27:54.880,0:28:02.260
natural relationship to the flat state
diagrams from the beginning of the lecture.

0:28:05.560,0:28:07.750
We will turn to
the evolution of a graph

0:28:07.750,0:28:15.340
from a Petri net, corresponding to
reachability relations, in the next video.
